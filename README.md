Note:

This server is a demonstration of my NestJS API development skills. Please note that it's not fully functional due to many stub functions. It showcases my ability to structure and implement API endpoints. Further development is required for real-world use.

This concise note highlights the purpose of the server, acknowledges its limitations, and suggests potential for further development.

All the API endpoints can be found on below endpoint, which is Swagger Documentation:
